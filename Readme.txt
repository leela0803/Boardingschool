service:BoardingSchool



New students join a school and need to be assigned to one of 4 boarding houses. As students come in,
they registertheirroll number, class & food preference. 
There are 2 classes - A and B, and two food preferences - V & NV. 
There are 4 boarding houses with equal but limited capacity. 


The service runs based on the following assumption.

● Queue will be processed based on the time a studentregistered, first in first out
● Boarding houses for students who prefer V cannot board NV students where as Students who prefer  NV can be assigned board V boarding school if NV boarding schools are filled
● Boarding houses for class A would be separate from boarding houses for class B
● Once all boarding houses are filled up to capacity, no more students can be allocated.
● Otherrules
○ Student can only be registered once, duplicate commands for same student may be
ignored
